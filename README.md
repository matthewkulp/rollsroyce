I owe major credit to #[Royce Haynes] (http://roycehaynes.com) for creating the #[Rolls Royce Theme] (https://github.com/roycehaynes/rollsroyce). 

I built this theme off of the Rolls Royce theme. Call it Rolls Royce Neue?

[Sample site here.] (http://107.170.214.228/)




## How to install

1. Navigate to your Ghost theme directory ghost/content/themes

2. Clone theme repo using below command ```git clone https://github.com/roycehaynes/rollsroyce "rollsroyce"```

3. Restart ghost and log into your dashboard

4. On settings page, select rollsroyce as theme and save.

5. To make custom changes, go to ```default.hbs``` and search for 'TODOs' to add things like twitter handle, google analytics ID, etc. This is a temporary fix to a problem in Ghost v0.4.
